</p>

* Review
    - `Sales Executive` role had the most employees while `Human Resources` was the opposite.
    - Overall, employees were quite satisfied, but it was worth noticing that at about 38.7% employees (who rated 1 or 2) were unsatisfied about their job.
    - I noticed in the departments having less than 110 employees, employees' rating didn't really differ significantly. I wonder if this is the case of sample size affecting the analysis result.
