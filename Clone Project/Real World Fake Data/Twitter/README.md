* `Review`
  - 6AM and 7AM are missing from the data.
  - The number of tweets increased significantly at 12AM, peaked around noon and then gradually decreased at later in the day.
  - Details expand occured mostly at 13PM and 19PM. This was maybe because people had lunch break and got off work so they had more time to spend on Twitter.

### Tweets by Day and Week

* `Review`
  - It seems like people were tweeting more on weekdays rather than the weekends, mostly on Monday in August/2020.
